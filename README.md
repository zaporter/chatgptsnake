# chatGPT prompt:
Can you write a README.md which describes how I built this app by iteratively working with chatGPT to slowly refine Snake. Please also mention https://www.latticeanimal.com/snake-howto.html so that they can go check out the actual prompts that were used to build this game. 

Please have https://www.latticeanimal.com/snake be front and center to ensure that the reader goes and tries the app.
